    <h1>Text Editor Documentation</h1>
    <p>
      Every now and then, in the SalemModLoader discord server, people will be like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Townie123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Does anybody know how to use the TextEditor plugin?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    or
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Townie123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        How can I change text in ToS2?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      So, here is how you do it:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Dump the XML of the game through the Mod Actions menu.
      \n2. Open the dumped XML of your locale (i.e. StringTable.xx-XX.xml).
      \n3. Use Control + F to find the line you are looking for. You may also go into the settings of the plugin and enable "Show Keys"
      \n4. Copy the ENTIRE line, including the <entry ...> and </entry> tags
      \n5. In the "Custom" folder (in the same directory the "Dumped" folder is in), create a new file with the same name as the dumped file (i.e. StringTable.XX-XX.xml)
      \n6. Paste in your entry and change your text.
      \n7. Surround it with <StringTable> on the line above and </StringTable> on the line below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example file:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">StringTable.en-US.xml</span>
      <p class="message">
        <StringTable>
        \n<Entry key="CINE_ROLE_REVEAL_ROLE">
        \n  <![CDATA[ Go get 'em, <shake a=0.3> %role%! ]]>
        \n<Entry key="CINE_TRIBUNAL">
        \n  	<![CDATA[ %name% started a vote on who gets to become a human piÃ±ata! ]]>
        \n</Entry>
        \n<Entry key="GAME_1" style="bad_alert">This dude is up to some shit...</Entry>
        \n<Entry key="GAME_287" style="lover_alert">Romeo! Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?</Entry>
        \n<Entry key="CUSTOM_LOOKUP_FULL_MOON" style="fullmoon">You look at the moon, in it's beauty, it's fullness... just kidding! you're probably dead if there's a [[#51]] or a level one [[#42]].</Entry>
        \n<Entry key="GUI_GAME_YOU_DIED">gg ez scrub</Entry>
        \n</StringTable>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Some things to note: 
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Do not change anything surrounded in <> or "CDATA"
      \n2. Anything in double square brackets is a reference [[:X]] is a keyword, and [[#X]] is a role. Because of this, no keywords or rols can be in your search with Control + F.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that, happy searching!
